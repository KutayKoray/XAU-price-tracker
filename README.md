## Database Integration

This application is designed to track gold prices in real-time and send Telegram notifications when the price drops by a specified percentage. Currently, the functionality stores data temporarily in a list and does not use any persistent database. However, in a more advanced version of the application, the following features could be added:

### Database Usage

- **Persistent Data Storage**: Price data can be stored in a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL). This allows access to historical data and enables advanced operations such as trend analysis.
- **Data Analysis**: Perform analyses on the data stored in the database (e.g., calculating average prices, identifying highest/lowest prices).
- **Scalability**: Using a database allows the application to scale for larger use cases, such as tracking prices for multiple users or different assets.

### Why Is It Not Necessary Now?

- **Simplicity**: The current application is designed to meet basic needs such as real-time price tracking and notifications. Database integration could complicate the functionality and unnecessarily consume resources.
- **Temporary Data Storage**: The application stores price data temporarily in a list, which provides a simple and fast solution.
- **Rapid Prototyping**: This project was developed to quickly prototype and test core functionality. Database integration can be considered as a step for future enhancements.

### Future Enhancements

If the application is to be developed into a more professional version, the following steps can be taken:

1. **Database Selection**: Choose a database such as SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB.
2. **Data Modeling**: Create a suitable data model for price data (e.g., fields such as date, price, asset type).
3. **API Integration**: Develop a REST API or GraphQL API for accessing the database.
4. **Dashboard Creation**: Add a dashboard for users to visualize historical data.
5. **JASP or SPSS**: Can visualize or make predictions about price based on the data
